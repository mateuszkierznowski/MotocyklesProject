# MotocyklesProject

Hello!
The clue of this project is to download a motorcycle Data from website and do the Regression with it.

In Scraping.py I downloaded a Data of 14k motorcycles using bs4

In MakingCSV.py I made an csv file

In ProjectCleans.ipynb I prepare Data for Regression

In MotocyklesRegression Using sklearn I made regression with R^2 = 73%

The csv of motocykles is under motocykle_clean.csv
