# Motocykles Project.

The clue of this project was to download a instances of 14.000 motorcycles from [website](https://www.otomoto.pl/) try too find a great model with can predict prices

## Decription.

In scrapper I have created a tool with download a Data from website
CSV contain cleaned csv file of motorcycles data
encoder contains a One Hot Encoder uses to properly encode input data
models contains models (NN, XGBoost, GradientBoost)

## How to use.

You just need to run get_price.py and pass the features of motorcycle:

## Conclusion.

Unfortunatelly the data set is to small to make a properly working model.
I ll try to increase the size of data set in the future in order to crate best engine.
